# Online book-hosting and support

When we produce your book with the digital-first [Electric Book workflow](http://electricbook.works), you can access your project's source files and their version-controlled history online. You can even make your own changes to the text and output your book in PDF and as a website.

To activate this service, you enter into a monthly book-hosting and support plan.

- We cover the cost of your access to all your books' private repositories on [GitHub](http://github.com) (where they're managed by us).
- You can use Fire and Lionâ€™s beta Electric Book Manager to output and even edit your book collaboratively.
- Our [friendly, experienced team]({{ site.baseurl }}/about#our-team) will provide email and video-call support to help you use GitHub and the Electric Book Manager.

One subscription gives you access to unlimited books in unlimited repositories managed by Fire and Lion. Subscriptions are priced per user.

> Please note that this is a new service built for new approaches and new software. Its features and pricing may change as we learn how best to provide a book-hosting service for modern publishing.

## Pricing

Your support needs will vary depending on whether a book is in development (e.g. on your frontlist) or largely complete (on your backlist). We offer tiers for each of these situations.
